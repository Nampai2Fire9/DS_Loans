For this particular originator, we do not have ability to select individual loans or stack rules. Hence, goal of EDA is identify parameters for forward flow, and conduct preliminary model fit. EDA includes
- Separation into categorial and continuous variables 
- Univariate and Bivariate visualizations (against default) 
- Variable Correlations: Categorical vs. Categorical / Categorical vs. Continuous
- Variable Importance
- Sklean Classification models: RF/Boost/LogReg/KNN/SVM
- Prelim Model Fit and portfolio construction using starting with top quintile
